This Number Pool Manager Web Application prototype allows a user to create a number pool that is sized based on the userâ€™s input.

The user is allowed to remove/retrieve  the smallest number available from the pool and  can do so repetitively if need.  But returning  numbers to the pool can be done at random, in any order.  Only numbers not currently in pool, previously retrieved, can be returned to the pool. 

 Some field validation is performed on input values. Alert messages are included to help with validation.  The pool contents are also displayed but limited to pools with 10,000 items or less.
